# Java-simple-addition-game
This project was done in my first year of university as an assignment, this is a simple java application that uses random() for a simple addition game
# First-Year Java App â€“ Random Number Generator

This is a simple Java console application developed during my first year of study. The program demonstrates the basic usage of Java's `Random` class to generate random numbers. It was created as part of an introductory programming assignment focused on learning the core concepts of Java such as variables, conditionals, loops, and object usage.

## Features

- Generates random numbers within a specified range
- Simple user interaction through the console
- Repeats the process based on user input
- Demonstrates the use of:
  - Java `Random` class
  - Loops (`while`, `for`)
  - Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
  - Basic input/output (`Scanner`)
